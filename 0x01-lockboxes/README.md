<h1>0x01. Lockboxes</h1>
<h3>Concepts needed for lockboxes</h3>
<ol>
<li><b>Lists and List Manipulation:</b>
<p>Understanding how to work with lists, including accessing elements, iterating over lists, and modifying lists dynamically.</p></li>
<li><b>Graph Theory Basics:</b>
<p>Although not explicitly required, knowledge of graph theory (especially concepts related to traversal algorithms like Depth-First Search or Breadth-First Search) can be very helpful in solving this problem, as the boxes and keys can be thought of as nodes and edges in a graph.</p></li>
<li><b>Algorithmic Complexity:</b>
<p>Understanding the time and space complexity of your solution is important, as it can help in writing more efficient algorithms.</p></li>
<li><b>Recursion:</b>
<p>Some solutions might require a recursive approach to traverse through the boxes and keys.</p></li>
<li><b>Queue and Stack:</b>
<p>Knowing how to use queues and stacks is crucial if implementing a breadth-first search (BFS) or depth-first search (DFS) algorithm to traverse through the keys and boxes.</p></li>
<li><b>Set Operations:</b>
<p>Understanding how to use sets for keeping track of visited boxes and available keys can optimize the search process.</p></li>
